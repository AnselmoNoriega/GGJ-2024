You wouldn’t kill another man, would you?

A fellow inmate, culled by the same wardens you were?


I had a wife, you know. She loved me more than anything.

Well, almost.

There was an incident. I wasn’t making her happy enough. It got a bit messy.

Bliss isn’t supposed to be messy. We were impure. 

Anyway, she doesn’t know me anymore. She didn’t want to keep such upsetting thoughts. 

I was less willing to forget.
